# UQ Python User Group

Welcome to the UQ Python User Group. We are a **gathering for Python users of any proficiency**, to help each other solve problems, share resources and tips, discover new features and hang out as a friendly community.

We meet monthly on the first Thursday of the month, at 10:00am, at the Unviersity of Queensland.
